<h1>Blocmetrics</h1>
There are plenty of good analytic services, but that doesn't mean you can't build a better one. 

Blocmetrics analytics service will offer a few key features:
<p>
    A client-side JavaScript snippet that allows a user to track events on their website.
    A server-side API that captures and saves those events to a database.
    A Rails application that displays the captured event data for a user.
